# How to make Dancing Line Levels
## Introduction
You might see people making really incredible levels and so you asked - "how to do that?"
Well I'll show you some list of it and some explanations on it!

## Programs
Most people primarily use game engines like:
- Unity : Most used by Dancing Line Fan-level maker, you can pretty much look up for templates on GitHub [Windows, Linux]
- Unreal Engine : A heavy but beautiful game engine, there's actually a template made by nullptr but I can't find it anymore [Windows]
- Blender Game Engine : I pretty much haven't tried this, but seeing Kaje, I think it's possible [Windows, Linux]

Some developers actually had made some standalone level editor ready to use (You can just Google these)
- Dancing Editor (Private)
- Arphros (Stable - Public [Android & Windows])
- Line Worlds (Unstable - Public [Windows])

Gaming platforms that allow mods or servers:
- Minecraft : Yeah, some people are crazy enough to make it in minecraft. I haven't found any link as to how use these though [Cross-platform for Bedrock Edition]
- Roblox : The project is discontinued but there's a prototype of it which I still didn't know if it works properly or not [Windows]

## Notes
- Game Engines usually require coding skills, if you're already good at it then you might wanna choose this category
- Standalone level editors are usually pretty buggy and glitchy but is most of the time ready to use if you just wanted to quickly make fanmade levels
- Gaming platforms usually is just a showcase, there's no real tutorial on how to make levels in this category
