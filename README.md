# ReDark Technology - A person that just code things as a hobby
 Hello there! My name is ReDark and I'm a programmer,
 usually I'm using C# because I used Unity and Visual Studio quite often
 I also used SharpDevelop because it's lightweight and I used it to create small programs
 
 Here are the links to my games :
